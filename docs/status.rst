Recent Updates
------------

2023-06-20:
- Implemented project file (.msee) saving and loading
- Created file format documentation and example project file
- Added robust serialization and deserialization for model components

2023-06-15:
- Completed Properties Editor panel with dynamic form generation
- Added support for various property types (text, numeric, boolean, etc.)

Known Issues
----------

- Model component deserialization needs to be completed once actual model classes are implemented
- Need to add validation for project file contents
- Need to implement undo/redo for file operations

Next Steps
---------

- Complete splash screen implementation
- Implement Node class and related functionality
- Develop basic visualization of nodes and elements
