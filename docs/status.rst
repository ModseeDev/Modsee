Recent Updates
------------

2023-07-15:
- Completed detailed documentation for grid customization feature (VIS-007)
- Created technical specification for customizable grid size and spacing
- Designed UI components for grid settings in both the Settings dialog and main toolbar
- Documented grid snapping functionality for precise model creation
- Prepared implementation plan with unit and integration testing strategy

2023-07-10:
- Implemented basic node and element rendering in VTK (VIS-001)
- Enhanced RendererManager to properly display actual model objects instead of sample data
- Added support for rendering different element types with appropriate visualization
- Implemented node visualization with customizable radius and color
- Added proper connection between ModelManager changes and visualization updates
- Ensured all model objects (nodes and elements) are rendered in their correct positions

2023-07-03:
- Implemented Node class with full coordinates and DOFs functionality
- Added comprehensive unit tests for Node class
- Created documentation for Node class usage and API
- Node class supports 1D, 2D, and 3D coordinates with appropriate DOFs
- Added methods for accessing and manipulating node coordinates and DOF constraints

2023-06-25:
- Implemented professional splash screen with modern design
- Added robust dependency checking system with version verification
- Created detailed error reporting for missing or incompatible dependencies

2023-06-20:
- Implemented project file (.msee) saving and loading
- Created file format documentation and example project file
- Added robust serialization and deserialization for model components

2023-06-15:
- Completed Properties Editor panel with dynamic form generation
- Added support for various property types (text, numeric, boolean, etc.)

Known Issues
----------

- Model component deserialization needs to be completed once actual model classes are implemented
- Need to add validation for project file contents
- Need to implement undo/redo for file operations

Next Steps
---------

- Begin work on VIS-007: Implement customizable grid system with size and spacing controls
- Begin work on VIS-002: Develop camera controls (rotate, pan, zoom)
- Begin work on VIS-003: Implement selection system for nodes and elements
- Complete implementation of MODEL-002: Element class and related functionality
