Recent Updates
------------

2023-07-03:
- Implemented Node class with full coordinates and DOFs functionality
- Added comprehensive unit tests for Node class
- Created documentation for Node class usage and API
- Node class supports 1D, 2D, and 3D coordinates with appropriate DOFs
- Added methods for accessing and manipulating node coordinates and DOF constraints

2023-06-25:
- Implemented professional splash screen with modern design
- Added robust dependency checking system with version verification
- Created detailed error reporting for missing or incompatible dependencies
- Added proper error handling and resilience in initialization process
- Improved user feedback during application startup
- Added unit tests for dependency checking functionality

2023-06-20:
- Implemented project file (.msee) saving and loading
- Created file format documentation and example project file
- Added robust serialization and deserialization for model components

2023-06-15:
- Completed Properties Editor panel with dynamic form generation
- Added support for various property types (text, numeric, boolean, etc.)

Known Issues
----------

- Model component deserialization needs to be completed once actual model classes are implemented
- Need to add validation for project file contents
- Need to implement undo/redo for file operations

Next Steps
---------

- Start implementing MODEL-001: Node class and related functionality
- Begin work on VIS-001: Basic node and element rendering
- Implement settings dialog for application preferences
