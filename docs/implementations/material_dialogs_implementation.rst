Material Creation Interfaces Implementation
====================================

Overview
--------

This document summarizes the implementation of the material creation interfaces for the Modsee application (FUNC-022).

The material creation dialogs allow users to create and edit various types of materials, including elastic, steel, concrete, 
aluminum, wood, and custom materials. Each material type has a specialized dialog with appropriate properties and validation.

Implementation Details
---------------------

1. **Base Material Dialog**
   - Created a reusable `MaterialDialog` base class for all material-specific dialogs
   - Implemented common metadata fields (name, description)
   - Added support for both creating new materials and editing existing ones
   - Provided validation and error handling

2. **Material-Specific Dialogs**
   - Implemented specialized dialogs for each material type:
     - **Elastic Materials**: `ElasticMaterialDialog`, `ElasticIsotropicMaterialDialog`
     - **Steel Materials**: `SteelMaterialDialog`, `ElasticPerfectlyPlasticSteelDialog`, `BilinearSteelDialog`
     - **Concrete Materials**: `ConcreteMaterialDialog`, `ElasticConcreteDialog`, `KentParkConcreteDialog`
     - **Other Materials**: `AluminumMaterialDialog`, `WoodMaterialDialog`, `CustomMaterialDialog`
   - Each dialog presents material-specific properties and validation
   - Added derived property calculations where appropriate (e.g., shear modulus, bulk modulus)

3. **Material Selector Dialog**
   - Implemented a `MaterialSelectorDialog` for users to choose which material type to create
   - Organized materials into tabs by category (Elastic, Steel, Concrete, Other)
   - Provided descriptions for each material type

4. **Integration with Main Window**
   - Added the `on_create_elastic_material` method that serves as the entry point for material creation
   - Updated module imports in `ui/__init__.py`

5. **Testing**
   - Created a test script (`tests/test_material_dialogs.py`) to verify the dialog functionality
   - Implemented a mock model manager for testing

Usage
-----

To create a new material, the user can:

1. Click on the appropriate menu item or toolbar button
2. Select a material type from the material selector dialog
3. Fill in the required properties for the selected material type
4. Click "OK" to create the material

To edit an existing material, the user can:

1. Select the material in the Model Explorer
2. Right-click and select "Edit" or double-click the material
3. Modify the properties as needed
4. Click "OK" to update the material

Future Enhancements
------------------

1. Add material preview/visualization in the dialog
2. Implement material templates for common material definitions
3. Add units conversion support for different unit systems
4. Improve error validation with more detailed feedback
5. Add advanced material types as needed for specific analysis cases

Conclusion
---------

The material creation interfaces have been successfully implemented, providing users with a 
flexible and intuitive way to define various material types for structural analysis. All material
dialogs follow a consistent pattern and integrate with the existing model management system.

The implementation completes task FUNC-022 as defined in the project requirements.
