System Architecture
==================

Overview
--------

This document describes the system architecture and component relationships of Modsee.

Component Relationships
---------------------

.. graphviz::

   digraph architecture {
      rankdir=LR;
      node [shape=box];
      
      "Component A" -> "Component B";
      "Component B" -> "Component C";
      "Component A" -> "Component C";
   }

System Components
----------------

Component A
~~~~~~~~~~

Description of Component A and its responsibilities.

Component B
~~~~~~~~~~

Description of Component B and its responsibilities.

Component C
~~~~~~~~~~

Description of Component C and its responsibilities.

Data Flow
---------

.. graphviz::

   digraph dataflow {
      rankdir=LR;
      node [shape=box];
      
      "Input" -> "Processing";
      "Processing" -> "Output";
   }
