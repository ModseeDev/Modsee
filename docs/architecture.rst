System Architecture
==================

Overview
--------

Modsee is an open-source GUI application for Finite Element Modeling (FEM) that enables users to build structural models and export them to OpenSees TCL or OpenSeesPy. The architecture follows a modular design to ensure extensibility, maintainability, and ease of feature additions.

System Components
----------------

Core System
~~~~~~~~~~

The central coordination component that initializes the application, manages dependencies between modules, and ensures clean communication between different parts of the system. Provides common utilities and services to all other components.

User Interface (UI)
~~~~~~~~~~

Manages all user interface elements, including the main window layout, dialogs, menus, toolbars, and interaction handling. Ensures consistent look and feel across the application while maintaining separation from business logic.

Model Engine
~~~~~~~~~~

The heart of Modsee, responsible for building, validating, and maintaining the structural model. Handles all model-related operations, implements the domain-specific logic, and manages model state transitions.

File System
~~~~~~~~~~

Manages all file operations, including saving and loading project files (.msee) and handling results data storage (HDF5). Provides a unified interface for all persistence operations.

Exporters
~~~~~~~~~~

Converts the internal model representation to output formats (OpenSees TCL scripts and OpenSeesPy code). Handles all the complexities of generating valid and efficient OpenSees code, including recorders for result capture.

Importers
~~~~~~~~~~

Handles the import of models from various sources, including .msee files and potentially other FEM formats in the future.

3D Renderer
~~~~~~~~~~

Visualization component based on VTK that handles all 3D graphics operations, model display, selection, and interaction. Supports both pre-processing and post-processing visualization modes.

Results Manager
~~~~~~~~~~

Processes and organizes analysis results stored in HDF5 format, providing efficient access to result data for visualization and post-processing operations.

Architecture Principles
----------------------

Modularity
~~~~~~~~~~

Components are designed with clear responsibilities and minimal dependencies, enabling independent development and testing. New features should be implemented as modules that integrate with the existing architecture.

Extensibility
~~~~~~~~~~

The plugin-based architecture allows for extending functionality without modifying core components. This includes support for new element types, material models, analysis procedures, and post-processing capabilities.

Separation of Concerns
~~~~~~~~~~

The architecture strictly separates model data, processing logic, visualization, and user interface. This ensures that changes in one area have minimal impact on others.

Error Handling
~~~~~~~~~~

A centralized error handling system provides consistent error reporting across the application. All components report errors through this system, which presents issues to users in a unified, user-friendly manner.

Configuration Management
~~~~~~~~~~

Application settings, user preferences, and project configurations are managed through a centralized configuration system that ensures persistence and proper defaults.
