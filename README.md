# Modsee

**Modsee** is an open-source graphical modeling platform designed to simplify the development of finite element models for OpenSees and OpenSeesPy users.  
It provides a modern, intuitive user interface for building, managing, visualizing, and exporting structural and geotechnical models, without the need for manual scripting.

---

## ✨ Features (planned)

- Graphical model builder (nodes, elements, materials, boundary conditions)
- Support for core OpenSees element types (2D, 3D, springs, soils)
- Material library management
- Project save/load system
- Export models to both OpenSees TCL scripts and OpenSeesPy scripts
- Integrated OpenSeesPy runner
- Model visualization with VTK or similar tools
- Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux

---

## 🛠️ Current Status

Modsee is in early development.  
Initial architecture focuses on building a modular, extensible, and scalable foundation to support long-term growth.

Stay tuned for early alpha releases and development milestones!

## 🚀 Goals

- Eliminate the complexity of manual OpenSees model scripting
- Provide an accessible tool for students, researchers, and engineers
- Support structural, geotechnical, and soil-structure interaction modeling
- Foster a strong, community-driven open-source ecosystem
